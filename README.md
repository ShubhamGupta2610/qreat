# QREAT (Workspace)

This repository contains a nested project at `app-7skf5ggu5gch/` (the full RQEAT app).

IMPORTANT: The `app-7skf5ggu5gch` folder is a nested Git repository and keeps its own history. I have not changed or removed `app-7skf5ggu5gch/.git` – this root README simply documents the structure.

How to work with this workspace:
- Open `app-7skf5ggu5gch/` to work on the RQEAT application.
- If you want the top-level repo to track the app contents instead of it being a nested repo, tell me and I can convert it (be careful: that removes the nested repo's separate .git).

Repository owner: https://github.com/ShubhamGupta2610/qreat

README added by automation to allow top-level commits without altering nested project.
